# LoRa and SAMD21 based Garage door- and Heater Controller
KiCad design files for my Garage door- and Heater Controller

- ARM® Cortex®-M0+ based atsamd21g18a microcontroller (way overkill of course, but easier to program than a tiny 8-bit micro)
- [RN2483](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN2483) LoRa wireless module
- USB-C for easy firmware updates - which are not really needed because I am going to implement over-the-air firmware updates

See [Schematic](images/schematic.pdf) and [3d-view](media/3d-view.png).
